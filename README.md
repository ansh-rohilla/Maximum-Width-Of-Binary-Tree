# Maximum-Width-Of-Binary-Tree
The provided C++ code calculates the maximum width of a binary tree. The width is defined as the maximum number of nodes between the leftmost and rightmost nodes in a single level, including NULL nodes. The algorithm uses a level-order traversal (BFS) with a clever indexing scheme to find the width.
